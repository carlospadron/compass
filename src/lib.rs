//! Compass is a library for working with geometries. It aims to allow the creation and manipulation of 
//! geometries, such as points, lines, and polygons. It also aims to provide functions for performing 
//! various computations on geometries, such as area, distance, and intersection.
//! It is mostly a copy of JTS (Java Topology Suite) library, but written in Rust. Although only 
//! a set of the features oj JTS will be implemented.
