- implement clone for coordinates
- is there an scenario where linestrings return no boundary?
- complete methods in geometry
- check that lines have at least 2 points
- evaluate the content of examples.txt
- do coordinates need dimension methods?
- do we need coordsequences? for duplicated coords and unclosed coord sequences?
- check geometry methods against geos, shapely
- do we need squares and hexagons functions?
- parallel versions of the methods in geometry
